# AmazonFilterScraper
Uses Beautiful Soup to scrape Amazon with specified filters. In the program you can specify an Amazon item and filters like max price, min price, min rating, and min number of ratings to find an Amazon item that fits your criteria. This program will scrape through multiple pages and will gather all items that fit your criteria and export that data into a csv file. I've also exported the date into a HTML file that makes it easier to open up the amazon pages.

# How to use
- Download the chrome driver for selenium. https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/
- On line 23 in the program change the path of the chrome driver to where you have it in your system.
